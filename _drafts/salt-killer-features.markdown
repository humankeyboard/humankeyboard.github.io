Salt (by SaltStack) is such a powerful tool. It is like the ring in the famous movie, it may turn you into something else. Not in a bad way though. 

I was reading this book about human brain and there was a claim about the tools / devices we are using. Claim was these tools become an extension of us. A car becomes an extension of our legs improving the distances we could travel. In the past having two healthy legs would increase the likelihood of our survival. Loosing one would make us desperate, now having a broken car makes us desperate. Computers and internet, is now like an extension of our neural system. We stopped memorizing as knowledge is out there, easy to find. Almost all of us have a smart phone which boosts many of our intellectual properties.

Salt is a tool that will give you super powers. Once it is in your life, you can't imagine a life without it.

I want to write little bit about some interesting features Salt has.
